## Tutorials

Use these tutorials to see in practice how to develop a **Glue42 Core** project. The tutorials are designed to take you all the way from setting up your first **Glue42 Core** project to using all major functionalities in a real environment.

## JavaScript

This is a pure JavaScript tutorial. We recommend starting with it, even if you are a React or Angular developer. Removing all additional libraries and frameworks will allow you to get a better understanding of **Glue42 Core**.

You can find the tutorial [here](../../tutorials/core-js/index.html).

## React

Apart from the main tools that comprise **Glue42 Core**, you can also use the [**Glue42 React Hooks**](../glue42-client/react/index.html) library which is based on React Hooks. This library makes using **Glue42 Core** in a React app easy and intuitive.

You can find the tutorial [here](../../tutorials/core-react/index.html).

## Angular

Using **Glue42 Core** in an Angular application is easy thanks to the [`@glue42/ng`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@glue42/ng) library. It is a thin wrapper that facilitates initializing the [**Glue42 Web**](../../reference/core/latest/glue42%20web/index.html) library and accessing its APIs.
